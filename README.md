This plugin

-  sets the moment locale to `de`
-  scans the folder "\_Daily" for quick notes (format: yyyy-mm-dd HHmmss), that are lacking a corresponding daily note (format: yyyy-mm-dd), and adds that daily notes
-  registers a callback to create a corresponding daily notes, when a quick note is newly created
